Automated Loan Sanctioning System developed with a vision to minimise hu- man involvement in the process of loan approval due to recent events of false loans granted in large numbers as well increasing numbers of bad loans being written of in large numbers causing huge loss to the countryâ€™s economy.


Many banks do not have an automated system specifically to manage loan ap- provals. This situation gives rise to loan frauds . To solve this problem, a loan sanction management system is needed to check whether a person should be given a loan and verification of loan lending records.
